# Assembly-Endgame-
This game you are fighting the forces of evil to try and save the world's programming languages from being extinguished only leaving the assembly language left. Essentially a rebranded version of hangman, but instead of drawing a little person, every time you get a wrong guess, you eliminate one of the programming languages from the world.
